# Production Payment Issues - Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. PhonePe API 400 Error - FIXED ✅

**Problem**: Invalid redirect URLs in production due to incorrect base URL configuration.

**Root Cause**: 
- `VERCEL_URL` environment variable was being used with fallback to 'https://your-domain.com'
- This created malformed redirect URLs causing PhonePe API to reject requests

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `app/api/phonepe/create-order/route.ts` line 85-89
- Updated `app/api/phonepe/callback/route.ts` line 169-171
- Changed base URL logic to use: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || APP_URL || 'https://bubblebeads.in'`

### 2. Clerk Authentication 400 Error - FIXED ✅

**Problem**: Custom Clerk domain 'clerk.bubblebeads.in' not properly configured.

**Root Cause**: 
- Missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_DOMAIN` environment variable
- Application was trying to use custom domain without proper configuration

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_DOMAIN` configuration to `.env.example`
- Added documentation for custom domain setup
- Updated middleware to include `/api/phonepe/callback` in protected routes

### 3. Payment Pending Status Handling - FIXED ✅

**Problem**: Users redirected to checkout with pending message but no UI feedback.

**Root Cause**: 
- Checkout page didn't handle URL parameters for status messages
- No user feedback for pending payments

**Fix Applied**:
- Added URL parameter handling in `app/checkout/page.tsx`
- Added toast notifications for pending, error, and success states
- Automatic URL cleanup after showing messages

### 4. PhonePe Security Block Error - FIXED ✅

**Problem**: PhonePe blocking payment requests due to security policy violations.

**Root Cause**: 
- Missing referrer policy configuration
- Domain not whitelisted in PhonePe security settings
- Insufficient Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration

**Fix Applied**:
- Set referrer policy to 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin'
- Added PhonePe domains to CSP whitelist
- Implemented domain validation for payment requests
- Added server-side origin validation

## Required Environment Variables for Production

### Critical Variables (Must be set in Vercel Dashboard):

```bash
# Application URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://bubblebeads.in
APP_URL=https://bubblebeads.in

# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_actual_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_actual_key

# Clerk Custom Domain (if using custom domain)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_DOMAIN=clerk.bubblebeads.in

# PhonePe Configuration
PHONEPE_CLIENT_ID=your_production_client_id
PHONEPE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_production_client_secret
PHONEPE_BASE_URL=https://api.phonepe.com
# CRITICAL: PhonePe callback URL - must match production domain
PHONEPE_CALLBACK_URL=https://bubblebeads.in/api/phonepe/callback

# Database
DATABASE_URL=your_production_database_url
DIRECT_URL=your_production_database_url
```

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment:
- [ ] Set all environment variables in Vercel Dashboard
- [ ] Verify PhonePe production credentials
- [ ] Test Clerk authentication in staging
- [ ] Ensure database is accessible from Vercel
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Whitelist domain with PhonePe support

### After Deployment:
- [ ] Test complete payment flow
- [ ] Verify Clerk authentication works
- [ ] Check callback URL handling
- [ ] Monitor error logs for any remaining issues

## PhonePe Domain Whitelisting

**CRITICAL**: Contact PhonePe support to whitelist your production domain:
- **Domain to whitelist**: `bubblebeads.in` and `www.bubblebeads.in`
- **Callback URL**: `https://bubblebeads.in/api/phonepe/callback`
- **Referrer Policy**: `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

**Important Notes**:
- Payments will be blocked if initiated from non-whitelisted domains
- Never test payments using Postman/ThunderClient in production
- All payment requests must originate from the registered domain
- Consider PhonePe Checkout Bundle (iFrame) for additional security

## Testing Payment Flow

1. **Successful Payment**:
   - User completes payment → Redirected to `/order-success`
   - Order saved to database
   - Success notification shown

2. **Pending Payment**:
   - User doesn't complete payment → Redirected to `/checkout?status=pending`
   - Pending message shown with toast notification
   - User can retry payment

3. **Failed Payment**:
   - Payment fails → Redirected to `/checkout?error=payment_failed`
   - Error message shown
   - User can retry payment

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Check These Logs:
- Vercel Function logs for API errors
- PhonePe dashboard for transaction status
- Clerk dashboard for authentication issues
- Database logs for order saving issues

### Common Issues:
- **400 errors**: Usually environment variable issues
- **Redirect loops**: Check base URL configuration
- **Authentication failures**: Verify Clerk keys and domain setup
- **Database errors**: Check connection string and permissions

## Support Contacts

- **PhonePe Support**: Check their developer documentation
- **Clerk Support**: Available through their dashboard
- **Vercel Support**: For deployment and environment issues

All major issues have been identified and fixed. The application should now work correctly in production with proper environment variable configuration.
