# ðŸ“§ Email Notifications Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ **Quick Setup (5 minutes)**

Your email notification system is already implemented! Just follow these simple steps:

### **Step 1: Get Resend API Key (Free)**

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up with your email
3. Verify your email address
4. Go to **API Keys** section
5. Click **"Create API Key"**
6. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

### **Step 2: Update Environment Variables**

In your **Vercel dashboard** (after deployment):

1. Go to your project â†’ **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
2. Add these variables:

```
RESEND_API_KEY = re_your_actual_api_key_here
ADMIN_EMAIL = your-business-email@gmail.com
```

### **Step 3: Domain Setup (Optional but Recommended)**

1. In Resend dashboard, go to **Domains**
2. Add your domain (e.g., `cleanpods.com`)
3. Add the DNS records they provide
4. Verify domain

**Without domain setup:** Emails will be sent from `orders@cleanpods.com` (may go to spam)
**With domain setup:** Emails will be sent from your verified domain (better delivery)
