# üìß Order Management & Notifications Setup

## üéØ **How You'll Receive Orders**

Currently, when someone places an order, you have **3 ways** to receive the order details:

### 1. **Console Logs (Current Setup)**
- Order details are logged to the server console
- Check Vercel deployment logs to see new orders
- Good for testing, not ideal for production

### 2. **Admin Dashboard**
- Visit: `https://your-app.vercel.app/admin`
- View all orders, filter by status
- See customer details, payment info, and items
- Real-time order management

### 3. **Email Notifications (Recommended for Production)**
